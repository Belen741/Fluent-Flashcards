You are my senior product engineer + UX designer. I’m building a web app called “Spanish for Nurses” with flashcards. The Excel deck already contains these fields per card:

- deck, card_id
- es, en
- audio_file, image_file
- cloze_option_1..4, cloze_correct
- mcq_question_es, mcq_option_en_1..3, mcq_correct_en
- tag_1, tag_2

GOAL (non-negotiable):
Implement “invisible spaced repetition” so the user feels: progress, variety, novelty.
The user must NOT feel repetition, friction, or “this delays me”.
Never show words like: spaced repetition, intervals, due, review counts, difficulty, levels.

UX RULES (must show):
- Landing: “Today’s session: X cards”, “Complete in about Y minutes”
- Progress bar
- Encouraging microcopy (e.g., “You’re doing great!”, “You’re expanding your nursing Spanish”)
- End screen: “Session completed”

CORE EXPERIENCE (Layer 1 default):
Each session is a smooth sequence of “normal flashcards”:
- image + audio button + Spanish sentence (es)
- button: “Show translation” (reveals English en)
- self-rating buttons: “I knew it” / “I didn’t know”
- Next (Enter)
No explicit drills visible by name.

INVISIBLE REPETITION CAMOUFLAGE:
Use the extra fields to create variety “behind the scenes”:
- If a card has cloze fields, occasionally show a quick fill-in step WITHOUT calling it “cloze”.
- If a card has mcq fields, occasionally show a quick multiple-choice step WITHOUT calling it “quiz/exam”.
These steps should feel like “a different card type” (variety) not “repetition”.

CARD FLOW:
A card can render in one of these surfaces:
A) Standard Card (default): image + audio + Spanish + Show translation
B) Quick Fill (camouflaged cloze): show Spanish sentence with blank and 4 options buttons
C) Quick Pick (camouflaged MCQ): show mcq_question_es + 3 English options

Rules:
- Never show more than ONE extra step per card.
- Keep extra steps short (max 1 interaction).
- After extra step, show the normal card surface (Spanish + Show translation) OR reveal translation automatically if user answered wrong.
- If user answered wrong in Quick Fill / Quick Pick, schedule that concept to reappear soon as another surface type later.

SCHEDULING LOGIC (simple, invisible):
Implement a session queue generator:
- New items appear 3 times within the session but camouflaged as different surfaces.
- If user fails (“I didn’t know” OR wrong in Quick Fill/Quick Pick), reinsert the same card soon (e.g., +2 to +4 positions) BUT with a different surface next time.
- If user succeeds, push it later (e.g., +8 to +14 positions) or to next day (persisted).
- Ensure the user never sees the exact same Spanish sentence back-to-back. Enforce spacing.
- Ensure variety: in any 10 cards, include at most:
  - 6 Standard
  - 2 Quick Fill
  - 2 Quick Pick
(Adjust as needed, but keep variety.)

DATA MAPPING (critical):
Parse the Excel into a Card model that includes:
- id, deck, es, en, audioFile, imageFile, tags[]
- cloze: { options[], correct }
- mcq: { questionEs, optionsEn[], correctEn }
Skip empty/undefined columns safely. Ignore “Unnamed” columns.

UI IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Add a “cardType” state and render the appropriate surface.
- Use the same Next button and keyboard Enter for flow.
- Keep design clean like the screenshots: centered card, big Spanish text, audio button, simple buttons.
- Do NOT add new navigation complexity.

PERSISTENCE:
Store progress locally (localStorage) for now:
- per card: lastSeen, stabilityScore or simple streak, nextDueDate (internal only)
- Session should be generated from due + new items.
But never display due dates or review counts.

DELIVERABLE:
1) Provide the exact code changes needed:
   - where to parse Excel and map fields
   - the queue/scheduler function
   - UI components for Standard / Quick Fill / Quick Pick
2) Make sure the app actually uses cloze_option_* and mcq_* fields in the experience.
3) Ensure the UI still feels like “normal flashcards” and not a test.

IMPORTANT:
Do not ask me questions. Make reasonable assumptions and implement.
